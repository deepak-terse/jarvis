## Ways to build an AI assistant

| Approach | Tools/Components | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|----------|-----------------|------|------|-----------|
| Rule-based Intent Recognition | regex, RASA, voice2json | Predictable, low compute, easy to maintain | Limited patterns, poor with variations | Simple, domain-specific tasks |
| Traditional NLP | NLTK, spaCy, Stanford NLP | Established, good for structured analysis | Limited context, needs feature engineering | Text analysis, basic language understanding |
| Fine-tuned Dialog Model | GPT, BERT, T5 | Strong language understanding, natural responses | Needs training data, computationally expensive | General conversation, complex understanding |
| RAG | Vector DB, embedding model, LLM | Factual, domain-specific, reliable | Complex architecture, retrieval challenges | Knowledge-intensive tasks |
| CAG | Context management, memory, generation | Coherent conversations, personalization | Complex implementation, error accumulation | Long conversations, personalized assistance |
| Hybrid | RAG + CAG + efficient model | Balanced performance, reliable | Complex integration, high maintenance | Enterprise applications, complex tasks |
